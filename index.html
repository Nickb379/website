    <h2> About me</h2>

    <p>
    Name: Nicholas Alexander Brown
    </p>
    <p>
    Age: 20
    </p>
    <p>
    Before I came to code nation I had done an apperenticeship in mig welding, My dream was to become a Underwater welder,
     but unfortantley the demand for underwater pipeline welders have declined due to changing over to more efficiant enegy sorces. 
    I became fully qualified level 3 in Mig welding and engineering B-tec in 2 years.
    I felt like i wasnt being challanged enough in that industry and wanted to try somthing new.
    So i decided to try out a coding course and to see if I would enjoy changing my career, since joinging codenation,
    I have decided that i would love to go into a career in coding, either the front end or back end development,
     im currently undergoing a 3 weeek course to build up my knowlage about coding and different things that you can apply the skills too.
     Since taking part in this corse I see coding is everywhere in everything we do in technology.
    </p>
    <div>
      <center><h3> Why Code nation?</h3></center>

    <p>
    For me Code nation is a new career oppertunity and will give me the skills to enter the technological workplace.
   I am looking to become a junior developer at the end of this 3 week corse by securing an apperenticeship from one of the pledges to code nation.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>
    Ive never done any coding or worked with any of the online
    technology, but since working within this new enviroment
    i have developed skills using javascript and learned how 
    develop a website and an app, this has prompted me to 
    persue a career in this field.

    <center><h2>Benifits of IT.</h2></center>
    <p>IT plays a vital role in the business world, almost all of the worlds company use the tools and functions it provides through use of the internet. Without I.T, time to do usual business would be significantly increased.</p>
    <p>
    Decreasing the time it takes to complete a task.</p>
    <p>Ability to multitask.</p>
    <p>Increase the volume of information that can be evaluated.</p>
    <p>Reduces the chance of error.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p> When planning projects, there are certain things that you can use to ensure sucsess; such as Methods, Tools and skills that you can apply.
    Questions like, how can we organise the files and tasks at hand? How do we know what applications to use? How much time will it take? Using kanban planning method on trello is useful to set tasks to individuals and organising them into lists that are easy to understand, also it gives the option for other people to look on and give advice or review your notes and see if they can add anything to your work.
    Such tools as slack and trello work together and gives good collaboration between people as you can use slack to help complete your trello bored from sharing relevant information on a group channel.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Some key project management skills are:</h3>
    <p>
    Motivation- it is key to have motivation for any project planning as without the motivation you wont put any effort into your work which is key to have a sucsessful project. </p>

    <p>Communication- communication is a big part of project planning, without good communication, nobody would know what needs doing or what is to be done or if any mistakes are missed due to no feedback.</p>

    <p>Organization- Without organisational skills, The project would be a mess and would take a significant ammount of time more than if it was organised </p>

    <p>Problem solving- without any problem solving skills, everyone would be stuck trying to figure stuff out withou researching the method on how to do it. </p>

    <p>Adaptability- n the workplace is when an employee can be flexible and have the ability to adapt to changing work conditions. Staying calm means not folding under pressure when something changes or a problem occurs. Developing a solution is being able to come up with a plan when there is a problem.</p>

    <p>Leadership- Leadership skills are key for project planning as the leader can set specific roles to individuals and this will make the tasks more time efficiant and you can set the tasks to the person who has stronger knowlage than another.</p>
    
            
    <p>“Being a good leader means that you do not only oversee and coordinate tasks and processes as a manager, but also outline the vision and define the road map, motivate and encourage," says Tatiana Danielyan who is deputy director of R&D at ABBYY, which provides document recognition, data capture and language processing software.</p>
            
    <center><h2> Planning</h2></center>
     <p>      
    I have planned what my website needs on trello and made a checklist so I can check off what I need and what I need to do, this will organise my work evenly and efficiently.
    Here is my<a href="https://trello.com/b/5rMu0fHE/website">Trello Board</a></p> 
    <div>
    <center><h2><Risks of failure in the projects</h2></center>
    <div>
    <p>Poor management: Poor management is when the project manager doesn't organise properly and not being able to recive or give feedback.</p>

    <p>Poor teamwork: Poor teamwork is when the team aren't working together and not communicating which will result in un-organised work.</p>

    <p>Poor effort:Poor effort is when someone doesnt try to do there work and dont put any effort in and this will result in a bad quality of work.</p>

    <p> organisation: Without good organisational skills, all of the work done by the team will be mixed up and this could lead to losing or misplacing work.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When a project has poor management skills, team-work and organisation, then this will set the project planning upto fail, this will result in unorganised files which could lead to losing data or multiple of the same items being done simultaneously and that would be a waste of time.
    </p>

    <div>
    <center><h2>Tech</h2></center>
    <p>
    First of all when selecting which technology best suits your project, you should find out what everyone is familiar with and knows how to use, its not always better to use new technologies to plan your project, its all about finding the most suitable for your project. We found that Slack and Trello are perfect for us designing an iOS app and developing them, as they’re collaborative and you can plan and map out the progress on trello and communicate on slack sharing information and working collectively as a team.

    Using trello helped me a lot when planning this blog, we planned each of the sectors into "to do", "doing" and "done", 
    this helped me organise my blog really easy as I could see which tasks that I had done and helped me progress a lot faster.
    Trello has abled me to share my work with others and this has helped me gain feedback which has helped me progress; 
    without having to go round asking everyone.
    Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
    For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, 
    though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
    Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history.
    GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool,
    GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.
    Github helped me as I was having a problem with my code and i asked someone on there and they spotted the error that i was having and corrected it.

    Many project documents such as business requirements can contain data that identifies someone idvidually.
    We have been trying to research the implications under GDPR and have not found a clear answer.
    However, if the personal information is captured electronically i.e. wordprocessor document, then technically GDPR applies.
    This means that the organisation and the project team will need to be able to search the project documentation if and when they receive a SAR.
    This could be very challenging and relies on all project documentation to be stored in the correct location i.e. not on their local hard drive, removable media, etc.

    Copyright is the right of someone who creates an original image.
    As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image.
    Only the owner has the right to reproduce the  work, display the work in public and copy the work or sell copies of the work to other people.
    When creating a website there are constraints and these are what you can and can't copy, such things as logos and things that are copyrighted.

    <P>
    Some people or organisations like employers, shops, local authorities and schools must take positive steps to remove the barriers you face because of your disability.
     This is to ensure you receive the same services, as far as this is possible,as someone who's not disabled.
     The Equality Act 2010 calls this the duty to make reasonable adjustments.
     The same rules apply with websites, you should make it within your best intreasts to consider people from all walks of life, 
     this could mean; dimming the colour on your website incase people have sensitive eyes, or big text so someone can see better.
     Other things such as language barriers, you could include having a change language button to accomadate people from different countries.
