        When Planning my project, Trello was essential as this enabled me to set out the plan, 
        moniter the progress aswell as being able to share my trello board with colleuges which 
        helped add more things to my trello board. Unfortantley we didnt start using the trello board
        until about half way through our project, and when we started using the trello board our team had all been
        added to one board and then we all started working on it and this made us end up with mulitple of the same 
        cards on the trello board, this was due to poor management and organisational skills.  </p>

        When creating my website using visual studio, it had many benifits as it was a lot easier using html than javascript, 
        the functions were easy to understand which made it easy to edit my website the way i wanted to, due to being new to using visual studio 
        it took a while to understand the functions, and finding the functions that i needed to edit my website, half way through
        develpoing my website my colleuge showed me a website that has all the relevent infomation on the codes that i would need
        to make what i wanted on my webiste.

        Overall in my opinion, using slack and trello were appropriate tools to use as they are very collebarative and easy to understand once you have got the hang of it, i would reccomend using these to anyone as they are really helpful in project planning.

        When designing my website, there are things that i would love to change, 
        such as adding a working button to my webside that re-directs you to this review page but i couldnt quite figure out how to do that but,
        i would say thats where i have a weakness of understanding the code that i requre to make the button. Im happy with
        the way that my website turned out, as i think it looks nice and technological, sometimes things would run smooth
        such as creating the background for my html, and putting pictures in.
        Id love to change the ammount of animation in my website as ive currently only got gifs, id love to create my own animation and use it on my website.

        I would make some improvements such as adding more content and pitures to my website, as there is a lot of empty space that
        i could use, i would improve the text by putting boxes around the text to separate the different areas of infomation that i have included on my page.
        But my page does include all of the requirements for the criteria that has been set which is what i need essentially.

        When making my website i could have improved productivity and efficiancy by making a group trello board 
        when planning my content and layout which could have made me more efficiant, someone from my group could have already
        resesarched the code i need to use and share this infomation with me so i could apply it the way i wanted too.
        I could have imorpved efficiancy and increased productivity whilst making my website by, taking regular brakes which would help keep me focused
        and get distracted less, and by focusing on the most important tasks first and not going back to different tasks,
         other things such as regulating the ammount of time i spent on a task and keeping track.
        </p>

        Next time when creating a website i would like to work in a team, this would make my project more efficiant,
        by doing this and communicating on slack, everyone could put all their knowlage together and help when someone doesnt understand somthing 
        this would improve productivity and understanding of the task at hand, this would also help the project progress a lot faster.

        I would test my website and see if all of the code is working by doing a unit test on the website, this will check every single component and individual units with software.
        I would also test using a user test on the website to evaluate and see if the website is doing everything correctly by using real people to 
        test my website.
